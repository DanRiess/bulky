 * Original Author: mandemeskel
 * Slightly enhanced by DanRiess
 *
 * This exists because `ipcMain.handle` does not allow
 * you to return rejected Promises with custom data.
 * You can throw an error in `handle` but it can only
 * be a string or existing error object. This means all
 * the error processing logic must live in main process
 * in order to figure out what string or error type to throw
 * in `handle`.
 *
 * This abstract allows us to send messages to `handle`.
 * If `handle` resolves to message with `rejected` equal
 * to true then this method throws an error with the object
 * that is cotained in the resolved promise. Everything else
 * is the same.
 *
 * This allows us to get custom error objects and use catch
 * in `ipc.invoke` calls. It also frees us to remove all the
 * error catching from `then` - since all failures will be
 * caught in ipcMain and rethrown here.
