# Bulky - a bulk trading layover tool for Path of Exile

Bulky is an in-game layover bulk trading app. It aims to provide a bulk trading experience that doesn't require alt-tabbing. It currently supports 12 item categories, but the highlight is 8-mod map trading, including regex searches. Regexes are also provided to the seller, meaning neither of you has to leave the game for the trade.
Other notable features include trading full fragment sets (among others Elder, Shaper or Legion Sets) or expedition logbooks (listed by their most valuable faction).
Your offers recompute and auto-sync once every 10 minutes. Manual updates are possible as well.

More info coming soon.
